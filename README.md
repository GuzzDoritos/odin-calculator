# odin-calculator

Last assignment in the Foundations course @ [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)!

Simply put, it's a calculator. However, I decided to do something fun: "recreate" **Windows XP's calculator!** (...at least in appearance mostly)

### You can access it [here](https://guzzdoritos.github.io/odin-calculator/)

There are still a lot of features missing, but I think at least the overall *vibe* is there. And besides, this project aims only to demonstrate all of the things I learned up to that point, so can't expect much advanced stuff.

Maybe eventually I'll rework this to have better code and add the remaining features.
